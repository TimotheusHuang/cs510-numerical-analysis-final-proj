The implementation of the three iterative methods are saved in “jacobi.m”, gauss-seidel.m”, and “sor.m”. For the experiment, “test-omega.m” contains the code used for the experimentation with values of ω, “comparison_initial_iterates.m” contains the code for the experimentation with different initialization strategies, and “comparison_all_sizes.m” contains the code for all remaining experiments.
